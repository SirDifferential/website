# Who am I

My name is Jesse Kaukonen. I'm a programmer and computer enthusiast located in Espoo, Finland. I've been interested in computers and video games since my early childhood. My interests lay mainly in parallel computing, 3D and graphics programming, hardware programming, video games and procedural generation. I'm not interested in web development / mobile phones if I can avoid it. I prefer programming in C, C++ and Python.

## Professional

### Delicode Ltd
#### Software developer (2014 - present)

I'm employed as a software developer at Delicode Ltd, working with [NI mate](https://ni-mate.com/) and [Z-Vector](https://z-vector.com/) among other projects. My work mostly involves infrared depth sensors, computer vision, analytics & metrics, graphics programming, 3D software (Blender, Maya, Cinema 4D etc), VR, server administration, and customer support.

NI mate is a program that communicates with USB depth sensors and processes their depth images into usable data. Examples of data that NI mate computes are skeleton joints from detected users, user location information, and floor planes. NI mate is used for interactive adverts, motion capture, education, and art installations.

Z-Vector is a real-time VJ visualization tool that creates a 3D point-cloud based visualization out of the captured depth + color feed. Z-Vector has been used for several music videos, such as Kebu - Deep Blue and Phantom - Scars.

### Tmi Jesse Kaukonen
#### Enterpreneur (2010-2017)

I ran my own business for several years, doing a few odd jobs here and there. This was mostly for some secondary income. I mostly did programming, consulting and 3D modelling.

### Renderfarm.fi
#### Distributed volunteer rendering (2010-2014)

During / after my intership at Turku Polytechnic I worked at a project called renderfarm.fi that utilized [BURP](http://burp.renderfarming.net/development/v2_files/) (Big and Ugly Rendering Project) for distributed volunteer rendering with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/) (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing). This was my first real programming job and I learned a ton. Unfortunately the project wasn't viable as a business and ultimately went defunct.

At renderfarm.fi I did coding, design, testing, customer support and server & database maintenance.

## Personal

### Proceduralis
#### OpenCL based procedural world generator

![](pics/proceduralis.png "Proceduralis")

Ever since I played Dwarf Fortress I've been fascinated by procedural world generation. I had studied the basic tools used by such games, but never truly implemented them in practise. As I got into studying some OpenCL I suddenly figured it would be fun to create a world using the GPU's immense computational power. You can read more about this project in the relevant [blog entry](http://jessekaukonen.blogspot.fi/2014/02/generation-of-procedural-worlds-using.html).

### Improved Netmelee Mod
#### Star Control 2 online play improvement

![](pics/balancemod.png "balance mod")

Originally created by the fellow going by the username Shiver, the Improved Netmelee Mod balances the very broken multiplayer supermelee of Star Control 2. The mod has been a work of love by Shiver, and to lesser part by myself and a few other people.  I was mostly involved in testing early on, but performed some development and maintaining tasks later on.

### Global Tech
#### Europa Univeralis 4 modification

![](pics/gtech.jpg "Global Tech")

A product of one day during which I wondered how EU4 would work if every nation in the game used western tech. After a spell of scripting the results were so fun I decided to publish the mod.

### Python MIDI
#### Synthesizer-to-python Star Control 2

Right, maybe I might have been slightly tired when I did this.

### batchrender.py
#### Sequential rendering plugin for Blender

![](pics/batchrender.png "batchrender")

Someone on IRC complained that Blender didn't have a tool for setting up sequential render tasks that the computer would automatically execute in a queue. As the Blender's Python API is pretty clear it didn't take long for me to write such a tool.

### KAAL
#### Short film

We created a short film for the Kill All Audio and Lights competition at Assembly 2009. The idea was to make a very loud and visual film that would be shown on the screen when the audience was to shut their audio systems and displays. The project included three graphics artists and one musician, with me mostly responsible for the landscape and props, as well as animation.
